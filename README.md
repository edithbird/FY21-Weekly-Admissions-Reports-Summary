## FY21-Weekly-Admissions-Reports-Summary

The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the Fall and Spring Admissions Reports and determine what information would be of value to the agency in assessing and optimizing the various campaigns. 
There are about 7 different reports for each anticipated  start term and not all of there reports are useful. However, the agency would welcome a summary of what's happening with inquiry and application generation for graduate, UG, TR, and OL products, both in and out of state, There may be other demographics  with appropriate information that would be helpful for them to know.

Follow up questions for John Tabor

I have a couple follow up questions on the weekly reports. 

1. At what point in the year do you start tracking a new admission cycle, i.e., from Fall 2020 to Fall 2021? The new reports start on the first Tuesday after September 1.  
2.When does the census report come out? This time I'm going to put it in my calendar.  October 15th is the date of the data collection so within a week of that the census report is released.  
3. I've attached a photo for this question on the inquiry report. In the rows for Applications...I assume this is referring to the referral source code APPL, or stealth apps. Am I correct in reading the chart that there were 3 sophomores who submitted apps in 2018? That's possible I guess we have people that don't understand the application process.  
4. Since there are fewer inquiries these days, would it make sense that the number in the Applications rows go up if people are still applying and just not taking the traditional routes to make inquiries? That will probably be the case.
5. How complicated would it be to add a new section category to the inquiry report? (I may have asked you this before and the answer was pretty complicated) Marketing assigns referral source codes to ad viewers who complete inquiry forms. It's easy enough for me to pull a report from SF on a regular basis, but it would also be cool for us to see how they do weekly on your report. In theory that could be done but with all the different referral codes it would probably be easier to create a whole new report for those codes.
